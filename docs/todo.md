# TODO

## Short Term

- [ ] Enable setting model version on testing, to compare performance of different models.
- [ ] Explore other models to see if similar results can be achieved with smaller (faster) models.
- [ ] Update testing for other guesser versions to compare performance on simplified version of the game.
- [ ] Clean up the codebase to make it more readable and maintainable.

## Long Term

- [ ] Upgrade GuesserV3 to tackle the full version of the game.
