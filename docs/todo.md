# TODO

## Short Term

- [x] Enable setting model version on testing, to compare performance of different models.
- [x] Explore other models to see if similar results can be achieved with smaller (faster) models.
- [x] Update testing for other guesser versions to compare performance on simplified version of the game.
- [x] Upgrade GuesserV1 and V3 to async architecture.
- [x] Create an async version of the test runner and add a test that will test V1 and V3 in parallel.
- [ ] Create an optimized version of the guesser v3 and try to reduce the processing time.
- [x] Clean up the codebase to make it more readable and maintainable.
- [ ] Create a gradio interface to test and compare the performance of the different guesser versions.

## Long Term

- [ ] Upgrade GuesserV3 to tackle the full version of the game.
